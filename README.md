### a dark VSCodium icon

Since the developers of VSCodium keep changing the icon, I've uploaded the one I liked best here,  
together with the Pixelmator template to re-create it. That's it.

To change the icon on macOS place the `VSCodium.icns` file in `/Applications/VSCodium.app/Contents/Resources/`.
